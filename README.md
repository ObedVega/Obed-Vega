# Hi :wave:, I'm Obed

### Hey there, I'm Obed Vega, and I'm a software engineer. My journey started with a degree in software engineering, and I've been on a relentless quest for growth ever since. I thrive on challenges, pushing my limits to keep evolving in my field.
### But life isn't all about code and algorithms for me. I'm also a sports enthusiast. Padel, basketball, and running are my go-to ways to unwind and stay fit. I firmly believe in holistic growth, not just professionally but in every aspect of life.
### So, that's me â€“ Obed Vega, a software engineer always striving to level up in my career and embracing the joys of life outside the tech world.
